# Cross-compiling

Generally scikit-build-core will try to account for environment variables that
specify to CMake directly how to cross-compile. Alternatively, you can define
manually how to cross-compile as detailed in [manual cross compilation] section.

## macOS

Unlike the other platforms, macOS has the ability to target older operating
systems with the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` variable. If that is not set, you
will get a wheel optimized for the current operating system. Popular
redistributable builders like cibuildwheel will set this for you.

:::{warning}

While CMake also allows you to specify this a few other ways, scikit-build-core
will not know you've set this and won't get the correct wheel name.

### Intel to AppleSilicon

On macOS, AppleClang has excellent support for making Apple Silicon and
Universal2 binaries (both architectures in one binary). Scikit-build-core
respects `ARCHFLAGS` if `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` is not in the cmake args. These
values are set by most redistributable builders like cibuildwheel when
cross-compiling.

:::{warning}

If you link to any binaries, they need to be Universal2, so that you get the
Apple Silicon component. This means you cannot use homebrew binaries (which are
always native, and not designed to be used for building portable binaries
anyway). Header-only dependencies, including NumPy, do not need to be
Universal2.

:::{warning}

If you manually set the arch flags in other ways besides `ARCHFLAGS`, or the one
special case above, scikit-build-core will not get the right wheel name.

## Windows

### Intel to ARM

Scikit-build-core respects setuptools-style `DIST_EXTRA_CONFIG`. If is set to a
file, then scikit-build-core reads the `build_ext.library_dirs` paths to find
the library to link to. You will also need to set `SETUPTOOLS_EXT_SUFFIX` to the
correct suffix. These values are set by cibuildwheel when cross-compiling.

## Linux

See [manual cross compilation] section for the general approach.

### Intel to Emscripten (Pyodide)

When using pyodide-build, Python is set up to report the cross-compiling values
by setting `_PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME`. This causes values like `SOABI` and
`EXT_SUFFIX` to be reported by `sysconfig` as the cross-compiling values.

This is unfortunately incorrectly stripped from the cmake wrapper pyodide uses,
so FindPython will report the wrong values, but pyodide-build will rename the
.so's afterwards.

## Manual cross compilation

The manual cross compilation assumes you have [toolchain file] prepared defining
the cross-compilers and where to search for the target development files,
including the python library. A simple setup of this is to use the clang
compiler and point `CMAKE_SYSROOT` to a mounted copy of the target system's root

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR aarch64)

set(triple aarch64-linux-gnu)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER clang)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER clang++)
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET ${triple})
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_TARGET ${triple})

set(CMAKE_SYSROOT "/path/to/aarch64/mount/")
```

For more complex environments such as embedded devices, Android or iOS see
CMake's guide on how to write the [toolchain file].

You can pass the toolchain file using the environment variable
`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`, or the `cmake.toolchain-file` pyproject option. You may
also need to use `wheel.tags` to manually specify the wheel tags to use for the
file and `cmake.no-python-hints` if the target python should be detected using
the toolchain file instead.

:::{note}

Because most of the logic in [`FindPython`] is gated by the
`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`, you generally should _not_ include the `Interpreter`
component in the `find_package` command or use the `Python_ARTIFACTS_PREFIX`
feature to distinguish the system and target components.

### Crossenv

[Crossenv] cross compilation is supported in scikit-build-core. This tool
creates a fake virtual environment where configuration hints such as
`EXT_SUFFIX` are overwritten with the target's values. This should work without
specifying `wheel.tags` overwrites manually.

:::{note}

Because the target Python executable is being faked, the usage of
`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` for the `Interpreter` would not be correct in
this case.
