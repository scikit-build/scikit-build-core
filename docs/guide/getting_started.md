# Getting started

If you've never made a Python package before, [packaging.python.org's
tutorial][] is a great place to start. It walks you through creating a simple
package in pure Python using modern tooling and configuration. Another great
resource is the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][]. And a tutorial can be
found at [INTERSECT Training: Packaging][].

You can also find examples:

- For pybind11, there's a example template at [pybind11/scikit_build_example][].
  For nanobind, [nanobind example][] includes the Stable ABI on Python 3.12+!
- There are several examples including scikit-build-core examples (including
  free-threading) at [scikit-build-sample-projects][].

We also keep
[a list of some of the projects using scikit-build-core](../about/projects.md).

## Quick start

There are several mechanisms to quickly get started with a package:

- Scikit-build-core ships an `init` command:
  `scikit-build init --backend pybind11 myproject` scaffolds the exact project
  this page builds (run without `--backend` to pick one interactively). The rest
  of this page walks through what it generates.
- [uv][] has built-in support for scikit-build-core. Just make a directory for
  your package and run: `uv init --lib --build-backend=scikit`.
- [scientific-python/cookie][] has a cookiecutter/copier template for making a
  package with all the suggestions in the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][].
- [buildgen][] can generate Python extensions with
  `buildgen new myext -r py/pybind11` (see all with `buildgen list`, includes
  pybind11, nanobind, Cython, and C extensions).

## Writing an extension

We will be writing these files:

```
example
├── pyproject.toml
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── src
    └── example
        ├── __init__.py
        └── _core.*
```

The `_core.*` source suffix depends on the language you pick below (`.cpp`,
`.c`, `.pyx`, or `.f`); SWIG additionally has a `_core.i` interface file.

### Source code

The compiled extension is built as `_core` and lives inside the `example`
package at `src/example/_core.*`. Select your binding tool using the tabs:

````{tab} pybind11

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/pybind11/src/example/_core.cpp
:language: cpp
```

````

````{tab} nanobind

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/nanobind/src/example/_core.cpp
:language: cpp
```

````

````{tab} SWIG

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/swig/src/example/_core.c
:language: c
```

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/swig/src/example/_core.i
:language: swig
```

````

````{tab} Cython

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/cython/src/example/_core.pyx
:language: cython
```

````

````{tab} C

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/c/src/example/_core.c
:language: c
```

````

````{tab} ABI3

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/abi3/src/example/_core.c
:language: c
```

````

````{tab} ABI3t

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/abi3t/src/example/_core.c
:language: c
```

````

````{tab} Fortran

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/fortran/src/example/_core.f
:language: fortranfixed
```

````

### Package init

The `src/example/__init__.py` re-exports the pieces of the compiled `_core`
extension you want as your public API, so users write `import example` rather
than reaching into `example._core`:

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/pybind11/src/example/__init__.py
:language: python
```

(python-package-configuration)=

### Python package configuration

To create your first compiled package, start with a pyproject.toml like this:

````{tab} pybind11

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/pybind11/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} nanobind

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/nanobind/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} SWIG

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/swig/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} Cython

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/cython/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} C

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/c/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} ABI3

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/abi3/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} ABI3t

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/abi3t/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

````

````{tab} Fortran

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/fortran/pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```

```{warning}
Fortran is hard to compile on Windows and macOS, as it is supported by neither
MSVC nor Clang; you'll need a separate toolchain like gfortran.
```

````

Notice that you _do not_ include `cmake`, `ninja`, `setuptools`, or `wheel` in
the requires list. Scikit-build-core will intelligently decide whether it needs
`cmake` and/or `ninja` based on what versions are present in the environment -
some environments can't install the Python versions of CMake and Ninja, like
Android, FreeBSD, WebAssembly, and ClearLinux, but they may already have these
tools installed. Setuptools is not used by scikit-build-core's native builder,
and wheel should never be in this list.

There are other keys you should include under `[project]` if you plan to publish
a package, but this is enough to start for now. The
[project metadata specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml)
page covers what keys are available. Another example is available at
[the Scientific Python Library Development Guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides).

```{note}
If your extension builds against NumPy, build against `numpy>=2.0`: NumPy 2.0
wheels are backward-compatible at the C ABI level, so a module built against
2.0 keeps working with older NumPy at runtime. Add a runtime floor in
`[project]` `dependencies` only if your code needs newer NumPy features.
```

(cmake-file)=

### CMake file

Now, you'll need a file called `CMakeLists.txt`. A few things are common to
every version below: scikit-build-core requires CMake 3.15, so there's no need
to set `cmake_minimum_required` lower than that. The `project()` line can
optionally use the `SKBUILD_PROJECT_NAME` and `SKBUILD_PROJECT_VERSION`
variables to avoid repeating information from your `pyproject.toml`, and should
specify exactly what language you use to keep CMake from searching for both `C`
and `CXX` compilers (the default).

````{tab} pybind11

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/pybind11/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

If you place find Python first, pybind11 will respect it instead of the older
FindPythonInterp/FindPythonLibs mechanisms, which work, but are not as modern.
Here we set `PYBIND11_FINDPYTHON` to `ON` instead of doing the find Python
ourselves. Pybind11 places its config file such that CMake can find it from
site-packages.

You can either use `pybind11_add_module` or `python_add_library` and then link
to `pybind11::module`, your choice.

````

````{tab} nanobind

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/nanobind/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

Nanobind places its config file such that CMake can find it from site-packages.
````

````{tab} SWIG

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/swig/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

You'll need to handle the generation of files by SWIG directly.

````

````{tab} Cython

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/cython/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

[cython-cmake][] provides the `cython_transpile` helper (via `include(UseCython)`)
that turns your `.pyx` file into a C source you can pass to `python_add_library`.
Add it to your build requirements as shown in the pyproject.toml above.

````

````{tab} C

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/c/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

`find_package(Python ...)` should always include the `Development.Module`
component instead of `Development`; see
[Finding Python](cmakelists.md#finding-python).

You'll want `WITH_SOABI` when you make the module to ensure the full extension
is included on Unix systems (PyPy won't even be able to open the extension
without it).

````

````{tab} ABI3

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/abi3/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

`find_package(Python ...)` needs `Development.SABIModule` for ABI3 extensions.

You'll want `WITH_SOABI` when you make the module. You'll also need to set the `USE_SABI`
argument to the minimum version to build with. This will also add a proper
PRIVATE define of `Py_LIMITED_API` for you.

```{note}
This will not support PyPy, so you'll want to provide an alternative if you
support PyPy.
```

````

````{tab} ABI3t

```{versionadded} 1.0
The free-threaded Stable ABI (`abi3t`) and the combined `cp315.cp315t` tag.
```

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/abi3t/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

The free-threaded Stable ABI (`abi3t`, PEP 803) is requested with
`wheel.py-api = "cp315.cp315t"`. Since `abi3t` is a subset of `abi3`, a single
free-threaded build emits the combined `cp315-abi3.abi3t` tag and loads on
every CPython 3.15+, free-threaded or not; a GIL build falls back to
`cp315-abi3`.

`USE_SABI` is set from `${SKBUILD_SABI_VERSION}` (3.15 for `abi3t`) rather than
hardcoded. CMake before 4.4 has no `abi3t` awareness, so the SOABI suffix is
taken from `${SKBUILD_SOABI}` and `Py_TARGET_ABI3T` is defined manually; both
become unnecessary on CMake 4.4+.

```{note}
`abi3t` requires CPython 3.15+ and the PEP 793 module export mechanism, so the
classic single-phase `PyInit_` entry point cannot be used.
```

````

````{tab} Fortran

```{literalinclude} ../examples/generated/fortran/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```

[f2py-cmake][] provides the `f2py_add_module` helper (via `include(UseF2Py)`)
that generates the f2py wrappers, builds the `fortranobject` support code, and
links it all into an importable module in a single call. Add it to your build
requirements as shown in the pyproject.toml above. You'll need gfortran on macOS.

````

Finally, you install your module. The `install(...)` line above targets the
`${SKBUILD_PROJECT_NAME}` package directory rather than `site-packages`
directly, which is what you want for a `src/example/` package layout - the
compiled `_core` lands next to `__init__.py`. A bare install (`DESTINATION .`)
would instead drop a single top-level extension into `site-packages`.

### Building and installing

That's it! You can install your package with any standard frontend; for example,
in a virtualenv:

```console
$ pip install .
```

The [build guide](build.md) covers all the frontends (pip, uv, `pipx run build`)
and the options for building, installing, and distributing your package.
