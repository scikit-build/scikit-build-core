# FAQs

This section covers common needs.

## Starting a new project

The easiest way to get started is to use the [Scientific Python cookie][], which
makes a new project following the [Scientific Python Development Guidelines][].
Scikit-build-core is one of the backends you can select. The project will have a
lot of tooling prepared for you as well, including pre-commit checks and a
noxfile; be sure to read the guidelines to see what is there and how it works.

Another option is the [pybind11 example][].

In the future, a CLI interface with a new project generator is planned.

## Multithreaded builds

For most generators, you can control the parallelization via a CMake define:

```bash
pip install -Ccmake.define.CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=8 .
```

or an environment variable:

```bash
CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=8 pip install .
```

The default generator on Unix-like platforms is Ninja, which automatically tries
to run in parallel with the number of cores on your machine.

## Dynamic setup.py options

While we will eventually have some dynamic options, most common needs can be
moved into your `CMakeLists.txt`. For example, if you had a custom `setup.py`
option (which setuptools has deprecated as well), you can make it a CMake option
and then pass it with `-Ccmake.define.<OPTION_NAME>=<value>`. If you need to
customize configuration options, try `[[tool.scikit-build.overrides]]`. If that
is missing some value you need, please open an issue and let us know.

## Finding Python

One common mistake when using FindPython is to request the `Development`
component, which requires the `Development.Embed` component, which will require
the Python libraries to be found for linking. When building a module on Unix,
you do not link to Python - the Python symbols are already loaded in the
interpreter. What's more, the manylinux image (which is used to make
redistributable Linux wheels) does not have the Python libraries, both to avoid
this mistake, and to reduce size. Instead, you should only request the
`Development.Module` component.

## Cross compiling

When cross compiling, FindPython may not get the correct SOABI extension.
Scikit-build-core does know the correct extension, however, and sets it as
`SKBUILD_SOABI`. See [the SOABI docs](#soabi).

## Things to try

If you want to debug a scikit-build-core build, you have several options. If you
are using `pip`, make sure you are passing the `-v` flag, otherwise `pip`
suppresses all output. You can
[increase scikit-build-core's logging verbosity](#verbosity). You can also get a
printout of the current settings using:

```bash
python -m scikit_build_core.builder
```

## Repairing wheels

Like most other backends[^1], scikit-build-core produced `linux` wheels, which
are not redistrubutable cannot be uploaded to PyPI[^2]. You have to run your
wheels through `auditwheel` to make `manylinux` wheels. `cibuildwheel`
automatically does this for you. See [repairing](#repairing-wheels).

## Making a Conda recipe

`scikit-build-core` is available on conda-forge, and is used in [dozens of
recipes][]. There are a few things to keep in mind.

You need to recreate your `build-system.requires` in the `host` table, with the
conda versions of your dependencies. You also need to add `cmake` and either
`make` or `ninja` to your `build:` table. Conda-build hard-codes
`CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles` on UNIX systems, so you have to set or unset
this to use Ninja if you prefer Ninja. The `scikit-build-core` recipe cannot
depend on `cmake`, `make`, or `ninja`, because that would add those to the wrong
table (`host` instead of `build`). Here's an example:

```yaml
build:
  script:
   - {{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv

requirements:
  build:
    - python                              # [build_platform != target_platform]
    - cross-python_{{ target_platform }}  # [build_platform != target_platform]
    - {{ compiler('c') }}
    - {{ stdlib('c') }}
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
    - cmake >=3.15
    - make                                 # [not win]
  host:
    - python
    - pip
    - scikit-build-core >=0.2.0
  run:
    - python
```

## Supporting free-threaded builds on Windows

Windows currently requires a little extra care. You should set the C define
`Py_GIL_DISABLED` on Windows; due to the way the two builds share the same
config files, Python cannot set it for you on the free-threaded variant.

[^1]:
    Due to a [bug in packaging](https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/160),
    some backends may mistakenly produce the wrong tags (including
    scikit-build-core < 0.9), but the wheels are not actually
    manylinux/musllinux, just mistagged.

[^2]:
    Platforms like ARMv6 that do not have a manylinux spec are exempt from this
    rule.
