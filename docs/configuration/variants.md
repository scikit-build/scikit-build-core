# Building wheel variants

```{versionadded} 1.0

```

```{warning}
This is an early preview of [PEP 817][] wheel variant support. The interface may
change, and it must be opted into with `experimental = true`.
```

Scikit-build-core can attach variant metadata to a wheel, producing a
variant-labeled filename (the label becomes the final field of the wheel name)
and a `variant.json` file inside `*.dist-info`. This lets you ship several
wheels for the same version that differ by hardware or library features (CPU
ABI, CUDA version, BLAS implementation, etc.).

## Declaring providers

Every namespace you provide must have a provider declared in the `[variant]`
table of `pyproject.toml`, and must be listed in `default-priorities`. The table
is required for the null variant too, since [PEP 825][] requires at least one
namespace in every variant wheel:

```toml
[variant]
"$schema" = "https://variants-schema.wheelnext.dev/v0.2.0.json"

[variant.default-priorities]
namespace = ["x86_64"]

[variant.providers.x86_64]
requires = ["provider-variant-x86-64>=0.0.1"]
plugin-api = "provider_variant_x86_64.plugin:X8664Plugin"
```

## Selecting a variant

Declare each variant you can build in `[variant.variants]`, keyed by its label:

```toml
[variant.variants.x86_64_v3]
x86_64.level = ["v3"]
```

Then select one with the `variant-label` setting, as [PEP 817][] describes. It
is **only allowed in config-settings or `[[tool.scikit-build.overrides]]`**; it
cannot be set at the top level of `[tool.scikit-build]`. When it is set,
[`variantlib`][] is added as a build requirement, and the experimental flag must
be enabled. For example, with `pip`:

```bash
pip wheel . -Cexperimental=true -Cvariant-label=x86_64_v3
```

This produces a wheel ending in `-x86_64_v3.whl`. Labels may only contain
lowercase letters, digits, `_`, and `.`. The label `null` is reserved by [PEP
825][] for the null variant, which has no properties; build it with
`-Cvariant-label=null`. It does not need a `[variant.variants]` entry.

The provider plugins for the namespaces you select are added to the build
requirements, and the properties are checked against them before the wheel is
written. A property the plugin does not list is an error. Providers declared
with `build-requires` are ahead-of-time plugins; their supported values are also
embedded into `variant.json` as `static-properties`, so installers do not need
the plugin. Providers declared with `requires` are queried again at install
time.

You can also set `experimental = true` under `[tool.scikit-build]` instead of
passing it every time.
