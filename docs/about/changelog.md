This version has several fixes; the new `remove` key in 0.10 had a mistake
making it unusable, this has been fixed along with the matching issue in the
tests. Editable installs failed if there was a folder matching an extension
name. Multiplexed paths were not supported for plugins, now they are. The
downstream nox job is also now a bit better.

using isolated build environments. The cache is now correctly cleared if this
occurs. An issue with a certain style of gitignore was also fixed.

Fixes:

- Automatically refresh the cache when required by @henryiii in #870
- `sdist.exclude` takes precedence over `.gitignore` by @alexreinking in #872

## Version 0.10.4

This version fixes the logic for handling the sysconfig variables on Windows for
the values that used to be only provided on UNIX. This mostly affects targeting
the Stable ABI on Python 3.13. Editable install rebuilds now work if you have a
`wheel.install-dir` set, too.

Fixes:

- Windows 3.13 stable ABI by @LecrisUT in #865
- Editable installs now respect the value of `wheel.install-dir` by @psalvaggio
  in #867

Fixes:

- Make sure encoding is specified in more places by @henryiii in #861

## Version 0.10.2

This release fixes a regression with 0.10 where a manually included file in an
sdist would get included twice, affecting some tools (like uv).

Fixes:

- Files included twice when they match `include_spec` by @abetlen in #857

## Version 0.10.1

This is a quick fix release with two patches for specific situations.

**Full Changelog**:
https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core/compare/v0.9.8...v0.9.9

## Version 0.9.8

This version ships a few more small fixes. Multi-target builds were missing
build arguments due to an exhausted generator. And some packages seem to
hard-code `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}` in the `install()` call, which is an
anti-pattern, but we can set that variable too. More tests now run on Python
3.7.

Fixes:

- Empty build arguments for some targets in multi-target build by @junrushao in
  #784
- Support packages that hardcode `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in their `install`
  commands by @henryiii in #786
- Logger shouldn't warn for missing lib on UNIX by @henryiii in #787

  @henryiii in #785

## Version 0.9.7

This release makes a few small fixes, enabling better Fortran support and
correct tags on MUSL. And releases now have Attestations on GitHub at
<https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core/attestations>.

Fixes:

- Set `CC` and `CXX` from sysconfig if not set by @henryiii in #782

- Logger unconditionally set to `DEBUG` in non-PEP 517 usage by @henryiii in
  #779

Documentation:

affecting other setuptools plugins.

Fixes:

- Improve error message when `metadata.version.provider` not set by @thewtex in
  #762
- Only inject logic if `cmake_*` keywords present by @kiwifb in #768
- Only replace color tags if the color is defined by @bnavigator in #764

## Version 0.9.5

This release fixes building for the Windows variant of free-threaded Python
3.13.

Fixes:

- Support Windows free-threading by @henryiii in #759
- Strip whitespace around generator so that it's passed through correctly by
  @vyasr in #748

Documentation:

- Note that `-C` options can be prefixed with `skbuild.` by @KyleFromNVIDIA in
  #754

CI and testing:

- Retry pypy if fails by @henryiii in #746
- Disable rpminspect on rawhide by @LecrisUT in #753
- Use uv for minimum version check by @henryiii in #679

## Version 0.9.4

This version supports the newly available free-threading variant of Python
3.13b1 (mostly related to skipping the stable ABI). We test this via the
manylinux/musllinux images. There's also a new feature requested by third-party
packagers; the ability to pass args directly to the build tool

Features:

- Add `build.tool-args` by @henryiii in #733

Fixes:

- Support free-threaded builds of Python 3.13+ on Linux by @henryiii in #741

CI and testing:

- Use pylint 3.2, gha reporter by @henryiii in #745
- Some minor improvements to running tests on some systems by @henryiii in #741

## Version 0.9.3

This version ensures the Hatchling plugin correctly indicates editable mode is
not yet supported, supports `CMAKE_ARGS` that have spaces, and has a bit of
other minor cleanup.

Fixes:

- Properly indicate lack of editable support in Hatch plugin by @ofek in #728
- Don't generate `entrypoints.txt` if none set by @henryiii in #729
- Don't warn if lib not found on UNIX, just debug by @henryiii in #730
- Support `CMAKE_ARGS` that may have spaces inside quotes by @vyasr in #727

Docs:

- Add FAQ entry on repairing wheels by @henryiii in #731

CI and testing:

- `macos-latest` is changing to `macos-14` ARM runners by @henryiii in #725

## Version 0.9.2

Quick fix for quick fix in 0.9.1; if `cmake` is a broken script (which can
happen if you pip install outside an environment then enter an environment,
there was an unbound local error instead of ignoring the broken cmake script.

Fixes:

- Unbound local error by @henryiii in #719

## Version 0.9.1

Quick fix for Pyodide (WebAssembly) builds.

Fixes:

- Try `--version` if `-E capabilities` fails by @henryiii in #717

## Version 0.9.0

This version adds the ability to `inherit` in override tables, matching a
similar feature added to cibuildwheel 2.17's overrides. You can now write out
extra metadata to `${SKBUILD_METADATA_DIR}`. A new Hatchling plugin is provided
as an experimental feature (will likely be made a separate package in the future
like the setuptools plugin).

The meaning of `wheel.exclude` has been changed to match on the wheel path,
rather than the source path. We could not find any projects that would be
affected by this change, so it was not added to the minimum-version protection
policy. This now allows you to ignore CMake outputs as well.

Features:

- Preserve additivity of `cmake.define` across `overrides` tables by @stubbiali
  in #564
- Add metadata dir access by @henryiii in #702
- Experimental hatchling builder by @henryiii and @aryamanjeendgar in #637
- Vendor pyproject-metadata by @henryiii in #703
- Always require pathspec by @henryiii in #711

- purelib should set py3 tag if unset by @henryiii in #661
- Validate description for 0.9+ by @henryiii in #709
- Support bools in config settings by @henryiii in #712

API changes:

- `extra_settings` for SettingsReader by @henryiii in #697
- `GetRequires` args changed by @henryiii in #699
- Make `from_file` a little more powerful by @henryiii in #700
- Metadata is part of the build backend by @henryiii in #708

Documentation:

- Fix hatch init command by @thewtex in #677
- Fix install strip default by @henryiii in #681
- Improve `ninja.make-fallback` description in the README by @thewtex in #676

- Some changes from uv job by @henryiii in #693
- Fix setuptools on Python 3.12 by @henryiii in #701
- Fedora: Port downstream PR-49 by @LecrisUT in #678

## Version 0.8.2

This version fixes a few small issues related to configuration. The wheel tag is
fixed when `wheel.platlib` is False, inplace editable installs ignore
`build-dir`, and `install-dir` no longer affects the generate path.

Fixes:

- Ensure `wheel.platlib` being false sets `<abi>-<platform>` as `"none-any"` by
  @jcfr in #655
- Inplace editable install should ignore `build-dir` by @henryiii in #644
- `install-dir` shouldn't affect generate path by @henryiii in #654
- Expand info printing by @henryiii in #651

Documentation:

- Clarify requirement for using "inplace" editable mode by @jcfr in #643
- Update README to use modern GitHub admonition by @jcfr in #641
- be explicit about what it means to "use SKBUILD_SOABI" by @minrk in #646

## Version 0.8.1

This version fixes two small issues with specific situations: if ninja/cmake is
present but not executable, and ninja on Windows not respecting the build type.

Fixes:

- Do not exit with exec permission error in ninja check by @thewtex in #626
- Include `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` on Windows Ninja by @henryiii in #640
- Use `-` vs `_` in error message by @nbelakovski in #638
- Make run command logged at info by @LecrisUT in #639

Documentation:

- Warning about using `cmake.args` for defines by @LecrisUT in #620
- Correct API usage example by @henryiii in #627

## Version 0.8.0

This version replaces the `cmake`/`ninja` minimum-version config option with a
more powerful free-form version field. Scikit-build-core will now respect
`CMAKE_EXECUTABLE` for finding CMake. You can override based on the build state,
allowing overrides for editable installs, for example. You can specify a build
tag (AKA build number). And you can define CMake variables from environment
variables.

Features:

- Add `build-tag` by @henryiii in #612
- Add `if.state` to overrides by @henryiii in #600
- Add `cmake.version` and `ninja.version` by @henryiii in #602
- Support `CMAKE_EXECUTABLE` by @henryiii in #603
- Config to set CMake variables with environment variables by @stubbiali in #565

Fixes:

Tests and internal:

- Compare uncompressed files by @henryiii in #610
- A couple of minor cleanups by @henryiii in #599
- Some preview Ruff touchups by @henryiii in #617

## Version 0.7.1

This is a quick fix for a downstream change in hatch-fancy-pypi-readme that
broke our plugin wrapper.

Fixes:

- Patch for change in hatch-fancy-pypi-readme by @henryiii in #593

CI and tests:

- Remove deprecated mypy setting (now defaults on) by @henryiii in #589
- Group dependabot updates by @henryiii in #584
- Use downstream tmt plans by @LecrisUT in #518

Docs:

- Fix a link by @henryiii in #568

**Full Changelog**:
https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1

## Version 0.7.0

This release features several large improvements to overrides: a new `if.any`
group to allow selections based on any item being true, and a new `if.env`
option for selecting an override based on environment variables. You can now
build pure Python packages with `wheel.cmake = false`, perfect for providing a
slower pure Python version of a package on unsupported systems via overrides.

There's also a new `inplace` mode for editable installs, which has drawbacks but
feels like the classic `"--inplace"` setting in setuptools and can enable some
tooling that would otherwise not support modern editable installs to work. If
you are using Cython to access `.pxd` files, modern ("redirect") editable
installs now support that. And to help avoid collisions with a future user
feature, config settings can now be passed with an optional namespace,
`skbuild.`, as well.

Features:

- Add inplace mode for editable installs by @henryiii in #553
- Add `wheel.exclude` by @henryiii in #560
- Support cmake-less runs (for overrides) by @henryiii in #550

in 0.5 if the minimum-version is set to 0.5+ or unset).

Features:

- Add build target support by @henryiii in #432
- Add component support and strip support by @henryiii in #430

Fixes:

- (setuptools) Avoid instantiating build too soon by @henryiii in #443

## Version 0.4.7

This version fixes a unused variable message in 0.4.6, along with a debug
logging improvement, and a few test fixes, including a regression in the recent
noxfile reworking.

- fix: remove `SKBUILD_STATE` unused message when building by @henryiii in #401

## Version 0.4.6

This release has one small new feature (access to `${SKBUILD_STATE}` from
CMake), and fixes an issue when adding read-only files on Windows with Python
3.7. Some testing and docs infrastructure updates should make it easier for

This version fixes issues with output being incorrectly interleaved with logging
messages. Symlinks are now followed when making SDists. And finally,
`SKBUILD_SOABI` is now correctly set when cross-compiling on Windows (Warning!
FindPython still does not report the correct SOABI when cross-compiling to ARM).

## Version 0.4.4

This version fixes some issues cross-compiling to Windows ARM when making
Limited API / Stable ABI extensions, and supports multiple config generators in
editable mode.

- Conditional ABI3 logic fixed by @henryiii in #352
- Set `Python_SABI_LIBRARY` by @henryiii in #352
- Editable installs now support multiconfig generators by @henryiii in #353

This adds support for CPython 3.12.0b1, and improves Stable ABI / Limited API
support (supported by an upcoming nanobind for Python 3.12). An editable install
fix allows running from any directory.

Fixes:

- Allow CMake to detect if limited API is targeted by @henryiii in #333 and #342

- Refactor settings by @henryiii in #338
- Document that `CMAKE_ARGS` supports space separators by @henryiii in #339

## Version 0.4.2

This is a quick followup to LICENSE file handing to closer match the current
draft of [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639). It also removes the
automatic optional Rich logging, which doesn't work well with Pip's subprocess
piping, being cropped to a very narrow width regardless of terminal size.

Fixes:

- Add `License-file` metadata entry & update default by @henryiii in #329
- Drop optional Rich logging/error by @henryiii in #330

Other:

- Update PyPI links by @henryiii in #331

## Version 0.4.1

A fix for LICENCE files being placed in the wrong place in the wheel. Now we
follow hatchling's structure of placing them in `*.dist-info/licenses`.

Fixes:

- LICENCE files were placed in the wrong place by @henryiii in #325

Other:

- Fix rpm inspect test failures by @LecrisUT in #324

## Version 0.4.0

An important fix/feature: LICENSE files were not being included in the wheel's
metadata folder. You can configure the license file selection via a new
configuration option, and a reasonable default was added. You can now select a
source directory for your CMakeLists.txt. A lot of work was done on the still
experimental setuptools backend; it still should be seen as completely
experimental while it is being finished.

Features:

- `cmake.source-dir` for CMakeLists in subdirectories by @henryiii in #323
- Add `LICENSE` file option by @henryiii in #321

Fixes:

- Ninja wasn't being used if present by @henryiii in #310
- Wheels were not including the `LICENSE` file by @henryiii in #321

Setuptools plugin:

- Refactor plugin as custom setuptools command by @henryiii in #312

## Version 0.3.3

This version improves WebAssembly support (Pyodide) and fixes a reported bug in
the new editable mode.

Fixes:

- Support prefix dir if toolchain has `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY`
  by @henryiii in #303
- Find wheel files before local files in editable installs by @henryiii in #305

Other:

- Use PyPI's new trusted publisher deployment by @henryiii in #306

## Version 0.3.2

Some small fixes for edge cases. Several docs improvements, too.

Fixes:

- Suppress Unicode errors in scripts dir and move on by @henryiii in #294
- Specify platform properly for non-MSVC Windows by @henryiii in #295

Docs:

- Doc updates by @zerothi in #287
- Add a bit to plugin instructions by @henryiii in #289
- Typos fixed by @afh in #291 and #292

## Version 0.3.1

This is a small release fixing a regression in some cases caused by adding
`Python_LIBRARY`. This has been reverted on non-Windows platforms, since it is
only needed on Windows.

Fixes:

- Support older setuptools-scm by @henryiii in #284
- Only set the lib for FindPython on Windows by @henryiii in #285

Docs:

- Fix incorrect tool name by @henryiii in #276
- Typo on tab Fortran (was Cython) by @zerothi in #279
- Fix wheel.packages by @henryiii in #282

Other:

- Change Fedora PR targets by @LecrisUT in #273

## Version 0.3.0

This version brings two new dynamic metadata plugins (wrappers for
`setuptools_scm` & `hatch-pypi-fancy-readme`). Third-party packages can now add
entry-points declaring `CMAKE_PREFIX_DIR` and `CMAKE_MODULE_DIR` entries.
Support has been added for requesting metadata without building. And
experimental support was added for editable installs, including an option for
automatic rebuilds.

Several fixes have been added as well, like SABI support, ARM cross-compiling
support for FindPython, scripts entries now process shebang lines, and setting a
`build-dir` with `{wheel_tag}` was not working before. The docs have been
started, with a quickstart for common situations, a page on configuration, and
some info on authoring a CMakeLists.

Features:

- Support dynamic metadata by @bennyrowland in #197 and rework by @henryiii in
  #251
- Support modules/prefix dirs by @henryiii in #255
- Add `get_requires_for_dynamic_metadata` by @henryiii in #235
- Make setuptools wrapper more generic by @henryiii in #225
- Experimental support for editable installs by @henryiii in #212, #268, and
  #271

  remove a unused variable warning by @henryiii in #272
- Support color printouts without Rich (pip requires `FORCE_COLOR`) by @henryiii
  in #266

Other things:

- Add Fortran testing and CI by @henryiii in #86
- Avoid internet usage in non-isolated testing by @henryiii in #247
- Add an SDist checker & fix contents by @henryiii in #253
- Add more setuptools types by @henryiii in #233
- Add FedoraProject rpm spec file by @LecrisUT in #201 and #241
- Better coverage handling by @henryiii in #270

## Version 0.2.2

This release makes a small improvement to the wheel file permissions (in line
with wheel 0.40). It also ensures the test suite will still pass in an
environment with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` already set. A few internal changes are
paving the way to 0.3.0.

Fixes:

- zipinfo should report regular files by @henryiii in #220

Tests:

- Support running in environments with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set by @LecrisUT in
  #221
- Report self version too by @henryiii in #222

Other things:

- refactor: use `from_pyproject` by @henryiii and @bennyrowland in #224
- chore: fix a mypy complaint on Windows by @henryiii in #217
- docs: add quickstart by @henryiii in #226

## Version 0.2.1

This release fixes the tag for Windows ARM wheels, and has some internal
refactoring to prepare for the next new features. A new `{wheel_tag}` value is
available for `build-dir`. Some basic setup was done on the docs, as well. Debug
logging and test output has been improved a little, as well.

Changes:

- Add `{wheel_tag}` for `build-dir` by @henryiii in #207
- Support for conda's `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` by @henryiii in #207

Fixes:

- Windows ARM tag by @henryiii in #215

- tests: nicer exit, minor refactors by @henryiii in #213
- refactor: minor changes & nicer environment logging printout by @henryiii in
  #214

## Version 0.2.0

This version adds local build directory support - you can now set `build-dir`
and reuse build targets. This does not yet default to on, so please test it out.
This can dramatically speed up rebuilds. If you want to mimic setuptools, you
can set this to `build/{cache_tag}`. Or you can chose some other directory, like
scikit-build classic's `_skbuild`. Along with this, we now have a native wheel
writer implementation and support `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`.

Scikit-build-core now also contains a backport of FindPython from CMake 3.26,
which fixes SOABI on PyPy and supports the Stable ABI / Limited API.

Features:

- Local build directory setting & build reuse by @henryiii in #181

## Version 0.1.0

First non-prerelease! Scikit-build-core is ready to be used. The remaining
limitations (like support for editable mode and build caching) will be addressed
in future releases. If you set `tool.scikit-build.minimum-version = "0.1"`,
scikit-build-core will try to respect old defaults when new versions are
released.
